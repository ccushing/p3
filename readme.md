Submitted by Charles Cushing for CSCI E-15 : Dynamic Web Application. Spring 2016

3/31/2016

This project provides two components which generate random data which would be used by a developer. The first, called Lorem Ipsum, generates random Lorem Ipsum text. Options for including lists and headers in the text are provided as well as the option for providing a range of paragraphs to include. The second component will generate random users. Options are availaable for including the User's full name, address, gender, picture, email address and password. The output can also be exported as a .csv file and the probability of a user's gender can also be selected.

The package fzaninotto/faker is used for generating random text and user data from the server.
